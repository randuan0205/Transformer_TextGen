## Purpose of this project:
1. learn how to build a modulized transformer model from scratch.
2. learn how to adapt transformer modules to a real world use case - text generation.
3. Practice on some important NLP concepts: tokenization, embedding.
4. 

## The project codes 1 (transformer modules):
tbd

p.s. All these modules are inspired by the Andrej Karpathy's teaching on youtube.  

## The project codes 2 (the jupyter notebook):
tbd

## Key learning from building the model
